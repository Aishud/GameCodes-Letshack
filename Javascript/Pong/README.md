## Gameplay
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen using the mouse. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
